Well, this is it - my first "proper" project.

I had fun making this one, to be honest, although it wasn't all smooth. I forgot to gitignore the modules folder and I accidentally pushed ~10k lines of code in prod.
I also feel like my code structure is all over the place (even though I tried to follow ESM, which I *technically* did) but you live and you learn, I suppose.

The app is fully functional and the site info is stored via localStorage.
